"""
This module defines a decorator used to add a `name` attribute to screen classes.

The `Screen` decorator is used to assign a unique name to a screen class. This name can 
be accessed through the `name` attribute of the decorated screen class. It also adds a 
`screenName` class-level attribute to the decorated class. Additionally, when `autoreloadUI`
is enabled, it ensures that the UI is properly reloaded upon screen display.
   
Note: The UI reload uses QTimer.singleShot with a delay of 0ms, which may introduce
a slight delay in UI updates as it processes the event in the next event loop cycle.

    A decorator that adds a `name` attribute and showEvent method to a screen class.

    This decorator assigns a unique `name` to a screen class. The `name` is set as 
    both an instance attribute (`self.name`) and a class-level attribute (`screenName`).
    It also ensures that `showEvent` is added to execute the reloadUI method when the 
    screen is displayed. If `autoreloadUI` is enabled, it ensures that the UI method
    is properly called upon screen display.

    Args:
        name (str): The name to assign to the screen class.
        autoreloadUI (bool): If True, ensures the class has a `UI` method and reloads it on show.

        decorator: A class decorator that adds the `name` attribute and `showEvent` method.
